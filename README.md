# The Missing Semester

Welcome to my personal notebook!

This is where I'm organizing my notes on the
Missing Semester of Your CS Education, found
at missing.csail.mit.edu!

Feel free to look around, I'll be transferring
the exercises and notes for each lecture from
my local Obsidian graph onto this GitHub repo
(also learning vim atm, editing the Markdown
file you're reading on the editor rn!)
